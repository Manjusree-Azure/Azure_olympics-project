# Data collection

Data Collection: Ingesting CSV files from My Github(Source dataset from Kaggele) repository to Azure datalake Gen2 and ingested the data using Azure data factory.

# Data Tranformation:

Data Transformation: Cleaning, transforming, and organizing the raw data into structured formats, making it ready for analysis using Databricks and store the curated data in Azure dadalake gen2.

# Data Storage:
Data Storage: Utilizing scalable storage solutions Azure Data Lake gen2 to store both raw and processed data.

# Data Analysis:
Data Analytics: Implementing analytics and reporting to generate insights, such as medal predictions, athlete performance trends, and country-wise statistics using Azure synapse analytics, here i used SQL for data querying and analysis.

# optimization
Optimization: Ensuring the system handles large volumes of data efficiently and is capable of real-time data processing during live events using powerBI or Tableu.
